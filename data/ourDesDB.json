We recommend that HIU’s are serviced after 2 years in operationMVHR Service and Maintenance Plans MVHR systems are a year-round, whole-home ventilation solution that is proven low-energy and highly efficient, typically installed in a utility room. MVHR is fast becoming the most common method of whole-home ventilation for new build properties.MVHR systems work by combining supply and extract in one unit. Moisture-laden, stale air is extracted from ‘wet’ areas, such as kitchens and bathrooms. The heat from this stale air is recovered via a heat exchanger, and this tempered air is delivered into the home's living areas.MVHR systems provide continuous trickle ventilation to ensure a consistent level of fresh filtered air into the property to maintain adequate indoor air qualityMaster Engineering can provide an ongoing service and maintenance package, available throughout the lifetime of the units.
